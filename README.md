#Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a fun way to meet your next BFF! Simply fill out the form, upload a photo, take the quiz and you'll be matched to someone whose answers overall most closely match your own.

This app uses express to make calls to the server and the push json objects from the back to the front end. The logic loops through the friends array and compares the user answers against  hardcoded friend answers within the system, ultimately returning a match of the friend whose answers have the lease amount of overall variance from the user answers.
